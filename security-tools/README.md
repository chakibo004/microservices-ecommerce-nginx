```

**Metrics:**
- System information (uptime, hostname)
- CPU and memory usage
- Network interfaces and statistics
- Disk usage
- Open ports and connections

---

### Service Monitoring - PowerShell (`monitor-services.ps1`)
Comprehensive service health monitoring:
```bash
docker exec -it security-tools pwsh /security-tools/scripts/monitor-services.ps1
```

**Features:**
- Health checks for all services
- Response time measurement
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Color-coded status reports
- Success rate calculation

---

### Security Audit - PowerShell (`security-audit.ps1`)
Full security vulnerability assessment:
```bash
docker exec -it security-tools pwsh /security-tools/scripts/security-audit.ps1
```

**Tests:**
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Security headers validation
- HTTP methods checking
- Directory listing vulnerabilities
- Exposed sensitive endpoints
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Generates security reports

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start the Stack
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Access Security Tools Container
```bash
docker exec -it security-tools bash
```

### 3. Run Network Scan
```bash
bash /security-tools/scripts/network-scan.sh
```

### 4. Monitor Services with PowerShell
```bash
pwsh /security-tools/scripts/monitor-services.ps1
```

### 5. Run Security Audit
```bash
pwsh /security-tools/scripts/security-audit.ps1
```

---

## üîç Common Use Cases

### Daily Health Check
```bash
# Quick health check of all services
docker exec -it security-tools pwsh /security-tools/scripts/monitor-services.ps1
```

### Network Discovery
```bash
# Discover all running services and open ports
docker exec -it security-tools bash /security-tools/scripts/network-scan.sh
```

### Security Assessment
```bash
# Before production deployment
docker exec -it security-tools pwsh /security-tools/scripts/security-audit.ps1
```

### SNMP Monitoring
```bash
# System metrics via SNMP
docker exec -it security-tools bash /security-tools/scripts/snmp-monitor.sh
```

---

## üìä Sample Commands

### Manual nmap Scans
```bash
# Scan specific service
docker exec -it security-tools nmap -sV -p 4000 order

# Scan Nginx with script scanning
docker exec -it security-tools nmap -sV --script vuln nginx -p 80,443

# Quick scan all services
docker exec -it security-tools nmap -sn backend
```

### SNMP Queries
```bash
# Get system description
docker exec -it security-tools snmpget -v2c -c public localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0

# Walk network interfaces
docker exec -it security-tools snmpwalk -v2c -c public localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2
```

### PowerShell API Testing
```bash
# Test specific endpoint
docker exec -it security-tools pwsh -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://order:4000/metrics"

# Test with authentication
docker exec -it security-tools pwsh -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://nginx/api/orders/ -Headers @{'Authorization'='Bearer token'}"
```

### Packet Capture
```bash
# Capture HTTP traffic to order service
docker exec -it security-tools tcpdump -i any host order and port 4000 -w /security-tools/reports/capture.pcap

# View live traffic
docker exec -it security-tools tcpdump -i any -n
```

---

## üìù Report Generation

Security audit reports are automatically saved to:
```
./security-tools/reports/security-audit-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.txt
```

Access reports:
```bash
# List all reports
docker exec -it security-tools ls -lh /security-tools/reports/

# View latest report
docker exec -it security-tools cat /security-tools/reports/security-audit-*.txt
```

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Scanning**
   - Run network scans weekly
   - Perform security audits before deployments

2. **Monitor Metrics**
   - Use PowerShell monitoring for real-time health
   - Set up alerts for service failures

3. **Review Reports**
   - Analyze security audit reports
   - Address critical and high-risk findings

4. **Update Tools**
   - Keep nmap and security tools updated
   - Refresh vulnerability databases

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- The security-tools container has access to all networks
- Docker socket access is optional (for advanced Docker operations)
- All scripts are mounted read-only for safety
- Reports directory is writable for audit logs

```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make scripts executable
docker exec -it security-tools chmod +x /security-tools/scripts/*.sh
docker exec -it security-tools chmod +x /security-tools/scripts/*.ps1
```

### SNMP Not Working
```bash
# Start SNMP daemon
docker exec -it security-tools service snmpd start
```

### PowerShell Issues
```bash
# Check PowerShell installation
docker exec -it security-tools pwsh --version
```
