## 🚀 Quick Test

### 1. Start Everything
```powershell
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 2. Run Network Scan
```powershell
docker exec -it security-tools bash /security-tools/scripts/network-scan.sh
```

Expected output:
```
===================================
Network Security Scan - E-Commerce Stack
===================================

Scanning Order Service...
Host: order:4000
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
4000/tcp open  http    Node.js Express
✓ Order Service is UP

Scanning Nginx HTTP...
Host: nginx:80
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.25
✓ Nginx HTTP is UP

... [more services]
```

### 3. Monitor Services with PowerShell
```powershell
docker exec -it security-tools pwsh /security-tools/scripts/monitor-services.ps1
```

Expected output:
```
========================================
  E-Commerce Stack Monitoring Script
========================================

=== Service Health Check ===

[✓] Order Service is HEALTHY
    URL: http://order:4000/metrics
    Status: 200
  Response Time: 45ms

[✓] Nginx is HEALTHY
    URL: http://nginx:80/stub_status
    Status: 200
  Response Time: 12ms

Summary:
  Healthy Services: 6 / 6
  Success Rate: 100%
```

### 4. Run Security Audit
```powershell
docker exec -it security-tools pwsh /security-tools/scripts/security-audit.ps1
```

This will:
- Check SSL/TLS configuration
- Validate security headers
- Test for vulnerabilities
- Generate a security report in `./security-tools/reports/`

### 5. Check SNMP Metrics
```powershell
docker exec -it security-tools bash /security-tools/scripts/snmp-monitor.sh
```

docker exec -it security-tools pwsh --version

# Check bash
docker exec -it security-tools bash --version

# List available scripts
docker exec -it security-tools ls -la /security-tools/scripts/
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test all scripts** to familiarize yourself
2. **Review security reports** and understand findings
3. **Customize scripts** for your specific needs
4. **Schedule regular scans** (e.g., nightly security audits)
5. **Integrate with CI/CD** for automated security checks

## 🌟 Bonus Tips

### Schedule Automated Monitoring
```powershell
# Run continuous monitoring (checks every 10 minutes)
docker exec -d security-tools pwsh /security-tools/scripts/automated-monitor.ps1 -IntervalSeconds 600
```

### Create Alerts
You can extend the PowerShell scripts to send alerts (email, Slack, etc.) when issues are detected.

### Export Metrics to Prometheus
The scripts already expose metrics that could be scraped by Prometheus for long-term trending.
